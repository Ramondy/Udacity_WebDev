### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in __init__.py
 to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server.
You will need to update the endpoints after you define them in the backend.
Those areas are marked with TODO and can be searched for expediency.

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.

## Backend Tasks

One note before you delve into your tasks: for each endpoint you are expected to define the endpoint and response data.
The frontend will be a plentiful resource because it is set up to expect certain endpoints and response data formats already.
You should feel free to specify endpoints in your own way; if you do so, make sure to update the frontend
or you will get some unexpected behavior.

DONE : Use Flask-CORS to enable cross-domain requests and set response headers.
DONE : Create an endpoint to handle GET requests for all available categories.
DONE : Create an endpoint to handle GET requests for questions, including pagination (every 10 questions). This endpoint should return a list of questions, number of total questions, current category, categories.
DONE : Create a GET (not POST) endpoint to get questions based on category.
DONE : Create a POST endpoint to get questions based on a search term. It should return any questions for whom the search term is a substring of the question.
DONE : Create an endpoint to DELETE question using a question ID.
DONE : Create an endpoint to POST a new question, which will require the question and answer text, category, and difficulty score.
DONE : Create a POST endpoint to get questions to play the quiz. This endpoint should take category and previous question parameters and return a random questions within the given category, if provided, and that is not one of the previous questions.
DONE : Create error handlers for all expected errors including 400, 404, 422 and 500.

## Frontend

The frontend should be fairly straightforward and disgestible. You'll primarily work within the ```components``` folder
in order to edit the endpoints utilized by the components. While working on your backend request handling and response formatting,
you can reference the frontend to view how it parses the responses.

After you complete your endpoints, ensure you return to and update the frontend to make request and handle responses appropriately:
- Correct endpoints
- Update response body handling

## README

The README file includes:
- detailed instructions for scripts to install any project dependencies, and to run the development server.
- detailed documentation of API endpoints and expected behavior, using the format taught in the course:
-- METHOD Url
--- Request parameters
--- Response body


curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"search":true, "searchTerm":"lake"}'

curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/questions -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"search":false, "question":"what is love again?", "answer":"please baby stop!", "category":"5", "difficulty":"2"}'
